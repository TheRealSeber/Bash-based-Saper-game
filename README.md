# Bash-based-Saper-game

Hi,

This is my the Mineswepper project.

I really had fun doing this. I've added some comments in case of there was anyone who would like to jump into my code.

Very big ammount of the columns is unsupported, however you can spam as much rows as you want.

Whole game is controlled in the cmd, run python main.py to play and have fun!
